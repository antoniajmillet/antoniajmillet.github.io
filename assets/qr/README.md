# Permanent Website QR Code

These QR-code files encode:

https://antoniajmillet.github.io/go/website/

The QR code intentionally points to the permanent redirect page rather than
directly to the website homepage. This allows the final destination to be
changed later without replacing QR codes that have already been printed.

The redirect destination is controlled by:

go/website/index.html

## Files

- `website-qr.svg` — master vector file for posters and printed materials
- `website-qr.png` — raster backup for programs that do not accept SVG files

Do not recolor, crop, distort, or remove the white margin from the QR pattern.
For designed materials, place the intact black-and-white QR code inside a
separate colored frame or background.

Temporary test parameters such as `?refresh=1` are not part of the QR URL.
